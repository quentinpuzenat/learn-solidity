# Learn solidity



The objective of this github repo is to track my progress towards smart contract development.

It includes:

- Solidity knowledge
- Javascript knowledge (SC interactions)
- Hardhat (or truffle for setting up my working environment)



**By the end of 2022**, I must be able to deploy several smart contracts on the blockchain (I am very interested in Avalanche) in order to create my own protocol or be employed at an innovative DeFi company.



Feel free to contact me for whatever reasons concerning blockchain or dev :)
